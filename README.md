# Total Library

Check it out on itch.io: https://mathematastic.itch.io/total-library

And a writeup on some of the tech: https://mathematastic.com/total-library

A replica of the library from Jorge Luis Borges' story *The Library of Babel*. Every single book in one massive library, all crammed into a 20MB download. No render distance limit, gaze off into infinity. Everything is generated in real-time.

Minimum specs:
* Resolution = 720p
* Computer = yes

(If things are slow, turn off shadows)
